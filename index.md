## Welcome to lewdry's gthub

My name is Lewis Dryburgh.

I am a Scottish technology professional and information acrobat, based in Sydney, New South Wales. I am passionate about digital innovation and using data to make things better.

I have extensive experience in developing and delivering digital solutions in Energy, Media and Government organisations. I hold a master’s degree in Information Management. My research and thesis, ‘Do you even document, bro?’, explored the management of information and organisational knowledge within Australian technology start-ups.

In 2011 I co-wrote; co-produced and performed in the ‘The Quotidian Revue’ at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe to generally positive reviews. I’m still talking about it.
